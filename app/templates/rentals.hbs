     <!-- this passes the filterByCity action
     of the rentals controller, to the list-filter component,
     where it can be invoked, when attempting to filter by city.
     the key-up of an input is bound to the method handleFilterEntry
     which internally calls this passed-in method
     QUESTION: if the action was moved to the route, would it work the same?
